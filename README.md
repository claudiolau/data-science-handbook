# Statistics
- [Q-Q plot](https://towardsdatascience.com/q-q-plots-explained-5aa8495426c0): To determine if two data sets come from populations with a common distribution, in most cases whether it forms a Normal Distribution.


# Hypothesis-Testing
- [A/B Testing](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/10/ab-testing-data-science/): A/B testing is a basic randomized control experiment. It is a way to compare the two versions of a variable to find out which performs better in a controlled environment.

- [F-test in regression analysis](https://towardsdatascience.com/fisher-test-for-regression-analysis-1e1687867259): To determine whether a complex model is better than a simpler version of the same model in explaining the variance in the dependent variable.

# Machine-Learning 
- [Linear Regression](https://towardsdatascience.com/assumptions-of-linear-regression-5d87c347140): Underlying assumptions before using regression.

# Timeseries
- [Cointegration](https://medium.com/ro-data-team-blog/measuring-correlation-ii-cointegration-for-time-series-analysis-f0f5e6f65f5): Synthetic stationary series from a linear combination of two or more non-stationary series.
- [Var Model & LSTM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vQ0W_qXMxk&feature=youtu.be): Multivariate analysis talk. 

# Evaluation
- [Metrics](https://towardsdatascience.com/forecast-kpi-rmse-mae-mape-bias-cdc5703d242d): Understanding criteria for KPI and pitfall of validation metrics. (ie. MAPE, MAE, ... etc.)
- [Probalistic Model Selection](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/577/is-there-any-reason-to-prefer-the-aic-or-bic-over-the-other): Differences between AIC or BIC, tradeoff between simple and complex models.
